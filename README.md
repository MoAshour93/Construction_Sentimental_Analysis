## 📋 Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to classify text sentiments as **positive, neutral, or negative** using various models. Sentiment analysis has applications across fields like **customer feedback**, **social media monitoring**, and **employee engagement**. This project explores and compares each model’s effectiveness, from rule-based methods to advanced deep learning techniques, highlighting their performance and potential uses.

## 📚 Models Used

This project includes 8 distinct models, each contributing unique insights into sentiment analysis:

1. **VADER Sentiment Analysis** 🗣️ – A rule-based tool for analyzing social media sentiment.
2. **TextBlob** 📜 – A simple and effective NLP library for basic sentiment tasks.
3. **RoBERTa** 🤖 – A transformer-based model for robust language understanding.
4. **Logistic Regression** 🔄 – A classic, interpretable machine learning classifier.
5. **Multinomial Naive Bayes** 🌐 – Effective for text classification using discrete features.
6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 📈 – Suited for high-dimensional text data.
7. **XGBoost** ⚙️ – A powerful ensemble learning method for structured data.
8. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** 🧠 – A deep learning model ideal for sequential data.

Each model is rigorously evaluated for accuracy, making this repository a valuable reference for comparing sentiment analysis techniques.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes essential libraries such as **NLTK**, **Transformers**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **TensorFlow**.

## 📂 Data Preparation

The project uses a labeled dataset with the following structure:
- **Sentence** – Text data containing various sentiment expressions.
- **Sentiment** – The manually assigned label (positive, neutral, or negative).

### Preprocessing Steps:
- **Text Cleaning** 🧹: Removing special characters and stopwords.
- **Tokenization and Padding** 🧩: For deep learning models like LSTM.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** 🔢: Converting text data into numeric format for machine learning models.

---

## 🚀 Workflow

The project follows these primary stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🧼 – Clean, stem, and transform text to prepare it for model training.
2. **Model Training & Evaluation** 📊 – Train each model on preprocessed data and assess accuracy.
3. **Performance Analysis** 📈 – Compare model accuracies and visualize results for deeper insights.

---

## 🔍 Results & Insights

Key insights from the model evaluations:

- **LSTM** achieved the highest accuracy (approx. 70%), showcasing strong performance with sequential data.
- **RoBERTa** closely followed (approx. 68%), excelling in understanding complex language.
- Classic models like **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost** performed consistently well, making them suitable for smaller datasets.
- Lightweight models, such as **VADER** and **TextBlob**, provide quick but less accurate predictions, ideal for scenarios needing rapid sentiment assessment.

Each model’s accuracy and performance metrics are documented, helping users select the best approach for specific sentiment analysis tasks.
